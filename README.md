27 minutes ago: How to Remote Play PS5 Games on Your Steam Deck

As gaming technology continues to evolve, the desire for cross-platform compatibility grows stronger. Gamers now seek ways to play their favorite console games on a variety of devices. One such combination that has caught the attention of many is the ability to remote play PS5 games on the Steam Deck. The Steam Deck, a powerful handheld gaming device developed by Valve, offers a new level of gaming portability. When combined with Sony's PlayStation 5 (PS5), it creates an unparalleled gaming experience. In this article, we will explore how you can remote play your PS5 games on the Steam Deck, providing a comprehensive guide that covers everything from setup to optimization.

Understanding Remote Play
What is Remote Play?
Remote Play is a feature that allows gamers to stream games from one device to another. Initially, this feature was developed by Sony for PlayStation consoles, allowing players to stream games from their PlayStation to other devices such as smartphones, tablets, or PCs. The PS5 takes this feature a step further by offering high-quality streaming with minimal latency, making it an ideal candidate for use with the Steam Deck.

Why Remote Play PS5 Games on the Steam Deck?
The Steam Deck is a handheld gaming device that packs the power of a gaming PC into a portable form factor. It features a custom AMD APU, a 7-inch touchscreen, and compatibility with a wide range of games through the Steam platform. Remote playing PS5 games on the Steam Deck allows you to enjoy console-quality games on the go, without being tied to your television. The ability to stream games from your PS5 to your Steam Deck provides a seamless gaming experience that combines the best of both worlds.

Setting Up Your PS5 for Remote Play
Step 1: Enable Remote Play on Your PS5
Before you can start streaming your PS5 games to your Steam Deck, you need to ensure that Remote Play is enabled on your PS5. Follow these steps:

Turn on your PS5 and navigate to the Settings menu.
Scroll down and select System.
In the System menu, select Remote Play.
Toggle the Enable Remote Play option to On.
Step 2: Link Devices
Once Remote Play is enabled on your PS5, you'll need to link it to your Steam Deck. This involves a few simple steps:

Access the Remote Play app on your Steam Deck (more on this later).
On your PS5, go to Settings > System > Remote Play > Link Device.
A code will be displayed on your PS5 screen. Enter this code on your Steam Deck to link the two devices.
Step 3: Adjust Power Saving Settings
To ensure a smooth Remote Play experience, it's essential to adjust your PS5's power-saving settings. By default, your PS5 might go into Rest Mode after a period of inactivity, interrupting your Remote Play session. To prevent this:

Go to Settings > System > Power Saving.
Select Set Time Until PS5 Enters Rest Mode.
Set the option While Playing Games to Don’t Put in Rest Mode.
Step 4: Prepare Your Network
For an optimal Remote Play experience, a stable and fast internet connection is crucial. Here's what you need:

Wired Connection: If possible, connect your PS5 to your router using an Ethernet cable. This will provide a more stable connection compared to Wi-Fi.
Wi-Fi Settings: If you’re using Wi-Fi, ensure your PS5 is close to the router and connected to a 5GHz band for better speed and stability.
Router Settings: Enable QoS (Quality of Service) on your router to prioritize gaming traffic, which can help reduce latency during Remote Play.
Setting Up Your Steam Deck for Remote Play
Step 1: Install the PS Remote Play App on Steam Deck
To stream PS5 games on your Steam Deck, you'll need the PS Remote Play app. Since the Steam Deck runs on a Linux-based OS, you'll have to take a few extra steps to get it up and running.

Switch to Desktop Mode: On your Steam Deck, press and hold the power button until a menu appears. Select Switch to Desktop to enter the desktop environment.
Open Discover Software Center: This is the app store for Steam Deck’s Linux OS.
Search for "PS Remote Play": You might not find the official app, but you can install Chiaki, an open-source PS Remote Play client.
Install Chiaki: Once installed, launch Chiaki from the Applications menu.
Step 2: Configure Chiaki on the Steam Deck
Chiaki requires a bit of configuration before it can connect to your PS5:

Retrieve Your PSN Account ID: This step is necessary for Chiaki to recognize your PS5. You can find tools online that help you extract your PSN account ID.
Enter Your PSN Account ID in Chiaki: Open Chiaki, and in the settings, input your PSN account ID.
Link Chiaki to Your PS5: As with the official Remote Play app, you’ll need to enter the linking code displayed on your PS5 when you attempt to connect for the first time.
Step 3: Optimize Display Settings
Since the Steam Deck has a different screen resolution than your TV, you may want to adjust the display settings to optimize the streaming quality:

In Chiaki, go to Settings.
Adjust the Video Resolution and Bitrate according to your preference. For the Steam Deck’s screen, 720p with a bitrate of 5-10 Mbps should provide a good balance between quality and performance.
You can also enable V-Sync to prevent screen tearing during gameplay.
Streaming PS5 Games on Steam Deck
Step 1: Launching a Remote Play Session
With everything set up, you’re now ready to start streaming your PS5 games on the Steam Deck. Here's how:

Launch Chiaki on your Steam Deck.
Select Your PS5 from the list of available devices.
Start the Remote Play session by clicking on your PS5’s icon.
Your PS5’s home screen should now be displayed on your Steam Deck. You can navigate and launch games as you would on your PS5.
Step 2: Using Controllers
The Steam Deck has built-in controls, but you might prefer using a PS5 DualSense controller for a more authentic experience:

Pairing the DualSense with Steam Deck:
On your Steam Deck, go to Settings > Bluetooth.
Put your DualSense controller into pairing mode by holding down the PS and Share buttons until the light bar starts flashing.
Select DualSense Wireless Controller from the list of available devices.
Once paired, you can use the DualSense to control your games on the Steam Deck.
Configuring Controls in Chiaki:
In Chiaki, go to Settings > Controller and ensure the DualSense is selected as your input device.
You can customize button mappings if necessary, although the default layout should work fine for most games.
Step 3: Managing Latency and Streaming Quality
To ensure a smooth gaming experience, you may need to manage latency and streaming quality:

Latency: Latency can be reduced by ensuring both your PS5 and Steam Deck are connected to the same fast and stable network. Consider using a wired connection for your PS5 and staying close to your Wi-Fi router with your Steam Deck.
Quality Settings: In Chiaki, experiment with different video resolutions and bitrates. Lowering the resolution or bitrate can reduce the demand on your network, leading to a smoother experience with less lag.
Performance Mode: If you’re experiencing lag or frame drops, consider enabling Performance Mode on your Steam Deck. This can be done through the SteamOS settings under Performance.
Troubleshooting Common Issues
Issue 1: Connection Problems
If you’re having trouble connecting your Steam Deck to your PS5 via Chiaki, try the following:

Check Network Settings: Ensure that both devices are on the same network and that your PS5 is using a wired connection for better stability.
Update Chiaki: Sometimes, bugs can be fixed by simply updating the Chiaki app to the latest version.
Re-enter PSN Account ID: If Chiaki fails to recognize your PS5, re-enter your PSN account ID and ensure there are no errors.
Issue 2: Poor Streaming Quality
If the video quality is poor or the gameplay is lagging, try these solutions:

Lower Video Resolution and Bitrate: As mentioned earlier, reducing the video resolution and bitrate in Chiaki can help improve streaming performance.
Switch to a Wired Connection: If possible, use a wired Ethernet connection for your PS5 to improve network stability and reduce latency.
Close Background Applications: Make sure no other applications are consuming significant bandwidth on your network.
Issue 3: Controller Not Working
If your DualSense controller isn’t working correctly:

Re-pair the Controller: Disconnect the controller and re-pair it with your Steam Deck.
Check Button Mapping: Ensure the correct button mapping is selected in Chiaki’s settings.
Test with Another Game: Try using the controller with another game on your Steam Deck to see if the issue persists, which might indicate a problem with the controller itself.
Advanced Tips for an Enhanced Experience
Tip 1: Use a Docking Station
Using a docking station with your Steam Deck can greatly enhance your gaming experience by allowing you to connect the device to a larger screen, such as a monitor or TV. This setup gives you the flexibility to switch between handheld and traditional gaming experiences.

Connect Steam Deck to Dock: Plug your Steam Deck into a compatible docking station.
Connect to a Monitor: Use an HDMI or DisplayPort cable to connect the dock to your monitor or TV.
Pair a Bluetooth Controller: For added comfort, pair a Bluetooth controller such as the DualSense with your Steam Deck.
Tip 2: Optimize Network Settings
Optimizing your network settings can make a significant difference in the performance of Remote Play:

Use Quality of Service (QoS): Prioritize gaming traffic in your router settings by enabling QoS. This ensures that your gaming data takes precedence over other types of data on the network.
Reduce Network Congestion: Limit the number of devices connected to your network while gaming to reduce congestion and improve performance.
Use a Wi-Fi Extender: If your gaming setup is far from the router, consider using a Wi-Fi extender to boost signal strength.
Tip 3: Customize Chiaki Settings for Different Games
Different games may require different settings for optimal performance:

High-Action Games: For fast-paced games, prioritize low latency by lowering the video resolution and increasing the frame rate.
RPGs and Strategy Games: For games that are less dependent on real-time actions, you can afford to increase the resolution for better visual quality.
Save Profiles: Chiaki allows you to save different settings profiles, so you can quickly switch between configurations based on the game you’re playing.
Tip 4: Experiment with Third-Party Accessories
Enhance your gaming experience by experimenting with various third-party accessories designed for the Steam Deck:

Cooling Solutions: If you’re planning on extended gaming sessions, consider using an external cooling solution to keep your Steam Deck running smoothly.
External Storage: Expand your storage with a microSD card or external SSD to store more games and apps on your Steam Deck.
Custom Skins and Grips: Personalize your Steam Deck with custom skins and grips for added comfort and style.
Tip 5: Remote Play on the Go
With the Steam Deck’s portability, you can take your PS5 games on the go:

Public Wi-Fi: If you’re planning to use Remote Play in public spaces, ensure the Wi-Fi connection is stable and secure. Consider using a VPN for added security.
Mobile Hotspot: Use your smartphone’s mobile hotspot feature to connect your Steam Deck to the internet when Wi-Fi isn’t available. Keep in mind that data usage can be high, so ensure you have an adequate data plan.
Battery Management: Remote Play can drain the Steam Deck’s battery quickly. Carry a portable charger or power bank to extend your gaming sessions.
